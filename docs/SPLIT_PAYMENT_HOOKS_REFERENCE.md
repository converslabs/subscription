## üÜï **NEW PAYMENT FAILURE HANDLING FEATURES**

### Enhanced Settings Integration

The Payment Failure Handling settings are now fully integrated into the WPS Pro Settings page, following the same pattern as the existing API settings. This provides administrators with centralized control over:

1. **Global Defaults**: Set default retry and grace period values for all products
2. **Email Management**: Control when and how failure notifications are sent
3. **Customer Experience**: Balance between immediate alerts and spam prevention

## üÜï **ACCESS TIME SETTINGS EXPLAINED**

### What Do Access Time Settings Do?

The Access Time Settings control **when customer access ends** for split payment subscriptions. This is crucial for managing customer experience and business revenue:

#### **Three Access Timing Options:**

1. **`lifetime`** - Lifetime Access After Completion
   - **Behavior**: Access continues indefinitely after completing all payments
   - **Use Case**: For products where you want to reward customers with permanent access after completing their payment plan
   - **Example**: A premium course with 4 payments - customers get lifetime access after completing all installments

2. **`after_full_duration`** - Full Subscription Duration (Default)
   - **Behavior**: Access continues for the full subscription period (payment interval √ó number of payments)
   - **Use Case**: Standard subscription behavior where customers get full value for their payments
   - **Example**: A 12-month course with 4 payments - access continues for 12 months from start date

3. **`custom_duration`** - Flexible Access Extension
   - **Behavior**: Access continues for a custom period after the first payment is completed
   - **Use Case**: When you want to give customers immediate access but control how long it lasts
   - **Example**: A 12-month course with 4 payments, but access continues for 6 months after first payment

### **Why This Matters:**

- **Customer Experience**: Controls how long customers can access your content
- **Revenue Protection**: Ensures customers pay for the access they receive
- **Business Flexibility**: Allows different strategies for different products
- **Access Control**: Prevents customers from getting unlimited access with partial payments

### **Global vs Per-Product Settings:**

- **Payment Failure Handling**: Now managed globally through WPS Pro Settings (applies to all products)
- **Access Time Settings**: Still configurable per product for maximum flexibility
- **Rationale**: Payment failures are business-wide concerns, while access timing is product-specific

### **Technical Implementation:**

The Access Time Settings are implemented through the `SplitPaymentHandler` class which:

1. **Calculates Access End Dates**: Uses different logic based on the selected timing option
2. **Handles Payment Completion**: Applies the appropriate access control when payments are completed
3. **Logs Access Decisions**: Records detailed activity notes explaining why access continues or expires
4. **Integrates with Cron**: Automatically expires access when the calculated end date is reached (except for lifetime access)

#### **Key Methods:**

```php
// Calculate when access should end
SplitPaymentHandler::calculate_access_end_date($subscription_id)

// Handle access control when payments complete
SplitPaymentHandler::handle_split_payment_completion($subscription_id, $payments_made, $max_payments)

// Check if access should be expired
SplitPaymentHandler::should_expire_access($subscription_id)
```

### Smart Email Delivery

- **Configurable Delays**: Prevent spam during temporary payment issues
- **Grace Period Warnings**: Proactive customer communication
- **Failure Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of all payment attempts
- **Customer Support**: Clear communication about next steps

### Automated Workflow

- **Retry Scheduling**: Exponential backoff for payment retries
- **Grace Period Management**: Automatic access control during payment issues
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time subscription status updates
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup when payments succeed
