# Tailwind CSS Usage

> The tailwind used here is scoped. So, it will not conflict to other styles.
> Tailwind classes will apply only if the root element has class "wpsubs-tw-root".

1. Run `yarn watch:tailwind` to start the CSS build process.
2. Call `subscrpt_include_tailwind_css()` to the file to load the Tailwind CSS.
3. Add `wpsubs-tw-root` class to the root element.
4. Start using other tailwind classes normally.
